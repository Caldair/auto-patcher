Auto-Patcher
	authored by pastime1971 and mateor(od)

A smali patcher that ports mods and themes across roms and devices. Extracts, decompiles/unpacks, patches, recompiles/repack, and outputs a flashable zip.

Current Stable version: tag 'v2.0.2'

Requirements for execution
   -jdk, cpio, patch


Designed to run on Linux, OSX and Windows (using Cygwin)

The main script expects the patches and patch_tools folders to be compressed. pastime has whipped up a script that gets you ready to use the program:

$./batch.sh

For usage and patch availability, place a rom.zip into this directory and try

$./auto_patcher <ROMNAME>.zip -h

This will check our various dependancies and provide some useful information.
 
To patch a ROM, 
$./auto_patcher <ROMNAME>.zip <MODTYPE> <ROMTYPE> <PATCHDATE>

where: 
   * ROMNAME is the literal name of the Rom.
   * MODTYPE would be a list of offered mods (as seen in the -h menu), separated by 
	commas and NO SPACES.
   * ROMTYPE is cm7,cm9,cm10,aokp,aokp-jb,aosp or aosp-jb.
   * PATCHDATE is the date the patch was made, pick the one right before your build 
	date from the available patches.

example:
$./auto_patcher cm-10-OFFICIAL-20120820-grouper.zip pdroid,v6supercharger cm10 20120824
