Auto-Patcher
	authored by pastime1971 and mateor(od)

A smali patcher that ports mods and themes across roms and devices. Extracts, decompiles/unpacks, patches, recompiles/repack, and outputs a flashable zip.

Requirements for execution

jdk, cpio, patch


Designed to run on Linux, OSX and Windows (using Cygwin)

The main script expects the patches and patch_tools folders to be compressed. At the moment you will have to do this yourself before running the program.

tar -cvzf patch_patches.tgz patches
cd patch_tools
tar -cvzf * ../patch_tools.tgz
cd ..
./auto_patcher -h 

The final command gives usage help.
